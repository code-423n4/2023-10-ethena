Hello, RFQ stands for Request for Quote?


[10/24/2023 23:31] kayin222_67827
Yup that's correct. The process is, users (or market makers) will do an RFQ by sending us the quantity of stETH for mints, and USDe for redeems. And we will respond with USDe quantity for mints, stETH for redeems. This is done off chain.

If they wish to proceed with the order, they will then sign the eip712 order based on the RFQ values and send it back to us

In case of a hack I believe, to limit the amount lost. I've read it somewhere in the docs and that's what I concluded at least.

What is the primary goal of the USDe contract?


[10/26/2023 11:43] kayin222_67827
custodianAddresses are our custodians. Copper/Fireblocks, etc. They will hold on to stETH where we delegate them to exchanges (instead of us sending funds to exchange directly)


[10/26/2023 11:47] kayin222_67827
stETH in the beginning, wETH most likely. because not all exchanges support stETH as collateral for ETH perps position and it's a process to get that onboarded. If insufficient exchanges support stETH as a we grow, we will start supporting wETH.

we may consider a very small percentage of centralised LSD (cbETH, etc), but due to added centralisation risk it will be an amount that can be covered under our insurance fund in case cbETH depegs.


[10/26/2023 11:48] kayin222_67827
that's correct. USDe will be equivalent to using DAI, USDC, USDT where it doesn't have any yield. There's legal requirements for us to seperate the stablecoin and the yield generating stUSDe hence holding just USDe does not provide yield.

[10/26/2023 11:51] kayin222_67827
In case of compromised minter role, the max loss is limited to 2x maxMintPerBlock. Hacker can mint 100k (if 100k is limit), gatekeeper spots mispriced tx and shuts down mint/redeem, hacker may be able to mint 100k again with high gas cost in the same block gatekeeper shuts down the contract.

Without this implementation, compromised minter key means someone can mint unlimited USDe and dump onto pools. We look to ensure any key compromise in the system can only cause limited damage

@kayin dm you, thanks


[10/26/2023 11:54] kayin222_67827
The assets we accept as collateral, stETH, possibly wETH in the future (depends on onboarding more exchanges allowing stETH as collateral). possibly very small % in centralised LSD. custodianAddresses is Copper/Fireblocks. They hold the stETH which we delegate to exchanges, instead of us sending collateral direct to exchanges


[10/26/2023 12:00] asui0944
can you please explain what Copper/Fireblocks are?  is it contracts or EOAs or what is it


[10/26/2023 12:01] kayin222_67827
This is not correct. MINTER_ROLE is held by Ethena. And only approved entities can do an RFQ, sign an order and submit it to Ethena. After which we run some checks, ensure the address is whitelisted, then we use our MINTER_ROLE to submit that order on chain.


[10/26/2023 12:02] 0xkral
I just copied it from the docs?ü§î


[10/26/2023 12:13] proxy1967

[10/26/2023 13:16] asui0944
So in EthenaMinting mint and redeem is not done directly by the user ? Who is going to have the minter and redeemer role


[10/26/2023 13:17] asui0944
And the gas fees is paid by the minter and redeemer right?


[10/26/2023 13:53] jvorex
@kayin hi, could you please explain that part of how you maintain delta neutrality in the readme better? this is what I can think of for the calculation but I‚Äôm unsure how you arrived at the calculations in the README


[10/26/2023 13:54] jvorex
@kayin shouldn‚Äôt it be that:

ETH is 2k a piece. If a market goes down 90%, the long 10 stETH should be worth 2k (200*10) down from 20k. While the short 10 ETH position opened at a perpetual exchange has an unrealized p&l of 18k (1800 * 10)


[10/26/2023 13:54] jvorex
If I now wish to redeem my USDe, the short perp position will be closed to realize the 18k profit which is 9 stETH (2k * 9) along with my original 10 stETH. So overall I should be getting 38k (18k + 20k)


[10/26/2023 14:30] rahiti
Do we all agree that we can come up with a scenario where a high privileged account (such as admin or owner) is compromised ?
In this case, we would have to show how this can be more destructive than expect by the protocol, right ?


[10/26/2023 14:48] niser93
I think that it could be a theme inside analysis, but not an high/medium issue


[10/26/2023 14:49] niser93
You should find a way to compromise a privileged account, if you are able to


[10/26/2023 14:49] al_qa_qa
This kind of things is considered as a medium one at least, but the protocol team made it a known issue in the code4rena docs.

[10/26/2023 15:32] plamkata
it is calculated in BPS instead of % because of integer maths


[10/26/2023 15:32] plamkata
10_000 BPS = 100% so if the total ratio is not 10_000, this means not 100% have been convered, or more have been covered

prevents duplicate orders from being processed by storing nonce


[10/27/2023 21:50] .akira0327
I think nonce will be produced on off-chain(maybe from backend), what's the nonce making algroithm?


[10/27/2023 22:49] newarkbg
Nonce can just use a random number you haven't used before


[10/27/2023 23:19] grobelr
Why does the remaining balance go to address.length -1 ?

```    uint256 remainingBalance = amount - totalTransferred;
    if (remainingBalance > 0) {
      token.safeTransferFrom(benefactor, addresses[addresses.length - 1], remainingBalance);
    }
```


[10/27/2023 23:26] asui0944
If the stakedUSDe contract which is the vault doesn't invest users USDe tokens to how will it give rewards


[10/27/2023 23:27] asui0944
And is the rewarder role suppose to be a contract or an EOA controlled by ethena team ?


[10/27/2023 23:31] lsaudit
I think, it has to go somewhere - so it goes to the last address from the list


[10/27/2023 23:53] limbooo9
I think this happens if one of the amountToTransfer in the loop truncated to zero `uint256 amountToTransfer = (amount * ratios[i]) / 10_000;` but it is very hard to occurs!

who has the minter role ?

i think whoever admim_role wants


[10/28/2023 10:44] saint6704
That's true but does ethena mints on users behalf who gets the minter role then


[10/28/2023 10:45] j4x_98
As far as I understand it it's also held by ethena, just not with the mutisig


[10/28/2023 11:30] titanicauditor
In ```USDe.sol``` there is a **function  renounceOwnership()** It just returns a revert an error  *** error CantRenounceOwnership().. ***  .. So why it is If it only revert a error?


[10/28/2023 11:31] noro9954
@kayin @deHB6 can you respond ?


[10/28/2023 11:36] niser93
It overrides method of underlying contract


[10/28/2023 11:44] proxy1967
from the docs
> The primary functions used in this contract is mint() and redeen(). Users who call this contract are all within Ethena. When outside users wishes to mint or redeem, they perform an EIP712 signature based on an offchain price we provided to them. They sign the order and sends it back to Ethena's backend, where we run a series of checks and are the ones who take their signed order and put them on chain.
> 
> By design, Ethena will be the only ones calling mint(),redeen() and other functions in this contract.


[10/28/2023 11:55] 0xnirlin
What is route? what purpose it serves while minting?


[10/28/2023 11:56] proxy1967
```solidity
  struct Route {
    address[] addresses; // addresses of protocol custodians that will hold to stETH and later transfer to exchanges
    uint256[] ratios; // ratios of amounts to transfer to custodian addresses, must be 10_000 or 100 bps
  }
```


[10/28/2023 11:57] proxy1967
from what I have gathered


[10/28/2023 11:58] 0xnirlin
makes sense, so stheth will be transferred to exchange by custodians and not directly via contracts?


[10/28/2023 11:59] 0xnirlin
Its a manual process?


[10/28/2023 12:00] proxy1967
yes the stETH will not be transferred via contracts. I have read it somewhere but can't remember exactly where, here or the docs

It allow users (EOAs) to make some smart contracts have control to there tokens.


[10/28/2023 16:13] 0xkral
In that case the signer will be the EOA right?

Yes, this is the protocol view for this mechanism in there docs.

Why are there two addresses in `Order` data type, `benefactor` and `beneficiary`. `beneficiary` takes the money, and `benefactor` is used to validate duplicate orders. I want to know why they used two addresses for this. what is the point?


[10/28/2023 16:53] limbooo9
yah it is ambiguous to me too! I think it only used when redeeming, when calling `_transferToBeneficiary`. while it checked to not be zero in both mint and redeem! hence, the signed Order can be used once and can not be used for both mint and redeem

What is the mechanism used to generate additional income when staking USDe? I read that this will occuar through staking, but I cant understand how they will participate in staking protocol like (lidoFinance) through USDe token.


[10/29/2023 13:11] oceansky
they are earning from funding fees provided by perpetual exchanges from shorting ether position and the other earnings is from yields of stEth.
USDe remains in the contract Staked USDe, this will be the factor in proper distribution of rewards. When you unstake, definitely your USDe  to be receive will increase because of rewards.

[10/29/2023 22:44] 0xstalin
if coolDown is active, redeem & withdraw functions won't work, only the cooldownShares or cooldownAssets, those functions would then be used when the stakers want to unstake stUSDe for USDe

[10/29/2023 23:22] mike_bello90
the user can use both functions cooldownAssets and cooldownShares interchangeably when the cooldown is active?


[10/29/2023 23:23] mike_bello90
or cooldownAssets should be used in a  specific situation and cooldownShares in another?


[10/29/2023 23:57] oceansky
they are basically the same, the difference is in the input (shares stUSDe) and the output (assets USDe), using interchangeably, depending on the user wants.

nah it's not a mandatory to read the whole documentation to participate in the contest. When contest starts there are some sections on the contest page: 1. Scope 2. Known issues 3. Out of scope. If any of these do not contain a link to some private audit, then findings from that private audit should be treat as in-scope


[10/30/2023 19:14] lsaudit
i just read that link - it seems it's all QA, but nonetheless - rules are rules. `Known issues` describes all the known issues which are out of scope. If there's issue from some private audit which is not mentioned there - it should be treated as valid - since it was not mentioned in `Known issues`


[10/30/2023 19:15] lsaudit
The same goes for some weird ERC-20 tokens. If contest doesn not define what kind of ERC20 tokens they accept, and someone submit an issue related to some fee-on-transfer or rebasing token - it's still treated as a valid finding (but downgraded to QA)

@üê∫wardens The **Ethena Labs** audit is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated üîç, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: The sponsor team and judge will review the findings over the next couple of weeks. Keep an eye on #üì¢announcements for regular updates on how the audit is progressing through awarding ü§ëüèÜ, judging üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è and reporting üìú. Feel free to ping a Contest-Admin if you have questions along the way!


[10/30/2023 20:02] mylifechangefast.eth
Oh nice so which is simple ENS or Ethena, can you tell?


[10/30/2023 20:02] asui0944
im still waiting for the report to be public to see what was the finding or can you dm me please


[10/30/2023 20:02] mylifechangefast.eth
Judging should start now, lol


[10/30/2023 20:02] j4x_98
I'd say ENS was way smaller codebase, but I also had the feeling here that it was pretty well hardened

4 days reading the hole docs, searching for any bug, but failed.

The problem is that most of the heavy logic is done off-chain, transfer staking rewards, approving minting and redeeming, admin controls the process. In addition to be previously audited by two companies and one solo.

Finding even a medium is difficult, because of the reasons I mentioned, or at least this is my opinion.

If someone found an easy, he will collect all the bucks, good luck guys in the next audit.


[10/30/2023 20:03] j4x_98
I also don't know which of my findigns got accepted i reported multiple med and one was ok as it seems haha


[10/30/2023 20:04] j4x_98
Yeah I'm also looking forwards to the results on this, especially as it was already tested by pashov without any HM, we'll see if there are any valid ones ü§î


[10/30/2023 20:04] mylifechangefast.eth
on ENS or which?


[10/30/2023 20:04] j4x_98
Yes


[10/30/2023 20:05] mylifechangefast.eth
Was ENS also audited by Pashov


[10/30/2023 20:05] j4x_98
No only this


[10/30/2023 20:05] mylifechangefast.eth
Oh


[10/30/2023 20:05] j4x_98
But ENS was also audited by some big company before afaik


[10/30/2023 20:05] j4x_98
So that's no guarantee that there are no vulns haha


[10/30/2023 20:08] mylifechangefast.eth
And there  was no HM found by Pashov


[10/30/2023 20:08] j4x_98

dailywaren says escalation period has ended. Any chance that result comes this week?

upps, you're right, asking at wrong channel, sorry about it üòâ


[11/13/2023 11:38] cryptothemex
how can we see feedback on submissions? and what is escalation? and how to do it?


[11/13/2023 12:43] lourenslinde
Once the report is made public you can see your submissions with feedback/comments.

The Escalations period in C4 is called Post Judging QA. 

When Post Judging QA opens wardens who have backstage access have a period of time (usually 48 hours, sometimes longer) in which they can comment on issues or raise any valid concerns with the judge before the awards are announced.


[11/13/2023 17:01] cryptothemex
thanks for info. much appriciated

[11/29/2023 00:29] young09778
I noticed that in the result, the `total` doesn't equla to the `sum of High, Med, and Gas`. Anyone knows why?

Is like the OGs didn't participate in this contest


[11/29/2023 07:29] wasabi_26768
Where can we see our submissions with comment? I wonder why High was rejected.


[11/29/2023 07:32] mylifechangefast.eth
Yours @wasabi


[11/29/2023 07:38] devabdee
you need backstage role for that or wait for the final report

First time participation. Will we be able to see our submission and feedbacks? A little wonder why some findings are rejected.


[11/29/2023 09:21] monrel
@ü¶ô liveactionllama | C4 is there a reason why judge did not take a look a  comment I made during PJQA? https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ethena-findings/issues/601


[11/29/2023 09:26] young09778
Hi. Do we need some roles to access this? It seems 404 to me~


[11/29/2023 09:27] monrel
yes, its backstage only.


[11/29/2023 09:27] young09778
Got it. Thanks. Will I be able to see my submission later on this?


[11/29/2023 09:27] monrel
yes, when report is out or when you get access to the backstage role.

read this.


[11/30/2023 14:23] wasabi_26768
I did


[11/30/2023 14:25] wasabi_26768
Also, why does someone has Total greater than sum of other columns?


[11/30/2023 15:23] _paperparachute
What is this referring to?


[11/30/2023 15:48] kimchi_the_dog
@PaperParachute | C4 I believe this

[11/30/2023 15:50] 0xsorrynotsorry
QA reports are not included in the table


[11/30/2023 16:17] kimchi_the_dog
ok, but why does the person have a total of 5 if they reported 3 mediums? did they send 2 analyses?


[11/30/2023 16:20] 0xsorrynotsorry
My bad, QA reports are not shown as a separate column but they're included in the total.
So yes, 3 mediums + 2 QA


[11/30/2023 16:23] kimchi_the_dog
Ok, so if I don't get additional points in the total for the analysis (even though I sent it), it means that it didn't meet the criteria, right?


[11/30/2023 16:25] 0xsorrynotsorry
Analysis reports are not included in the table either. Not even on total column


[11/30/2023 20:31] ivanfitro
the rewards are payed with USDT?


[11/30/2023 21:48] wasabi_26768
You just said that they are included in Total üôÇ


[12/01/2023 04:33] 0xsorrynotsorry
That's for the QA report. Analysis report is not included

Can you send more Analysis reports than 1?


[12/04/2023 12:38] young09778
Hi, does anyone know when will the findings get published?


[12/04/2023 15:13] _paperparachute
